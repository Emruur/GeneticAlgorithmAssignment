Questions:

1. LABS

* What should the algorithm be able to achieve in 5000 iterations? We have 4 (ocassionally 5), but we know that theoretical 
max is 7.

HELP US IMPROVE?

2. N-Queens

* What does score -200 means? 
* Is 0 what should be achieved?
* What does y = 5 or 6 mean?
* Where to find 0 from the plot?

* HOW CAN WE CHANGE REPRESENTTION IF WE CANNOT????????!
We understand we could change the way the initial poplation looks. How can we know how to change it if we have no clue how the 
fitness function works?
